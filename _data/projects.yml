    - Facial composites are widely used in forensics to generate images of suspects.
    Since the victim or witness usually isn’t good at drawing, computer-aided generation
    is applied to reconstruct the face attacker. One of the most commonly used techniques
    is evolutionary systems that compose the final face from many predefined parts.

    - In this project, I implement an app for creating a facial composite that will be able
    to construct desired faces without explicitly providing databases of templates.
    I apply Variational Autoencoders, Gaussian processes, and Bayesian Optimization
    for this task.

    LSTMs and Convolutional Neural Networks!

    - I have used TensorFlow’s pretrained InceptionNet as a encoder network and dynamic
    stacked LSTM as a decoder network. All the images provided as input are converted
    to vectors of a fixed length and this vectors are a input to the one-to-many LSTM
    that outputs a english caption for the image.

    - I have used finetuning using Keras for the task for about 30 epochs. It produces
    reasonable captions while testing on internet images. You can also test an image by
    uploading it to the internet and running the last couple of cells of the notebook.
