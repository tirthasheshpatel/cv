    In this article, I have implemented a fully vectorized code for Artificial Neural Network
    with Dropout and L2 Regularization.
  description: >
    - In this article, I have implemented a fully vectorized python code of an Artificial Neural
    Network tested on multiple datasets. Further, dropout and L2 regularization techniques are
    implemented and explained in detail.

    - Got 200+ claps (appreciation on medium).

    - Published in [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/).

    This article explores the famous graph traversals, namely, Depth First Search (DFS), Breadth First Search (BFS),
    Uniform Cost Search (Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm), A-Star Search, Weighed A-Star Search and Learning Real Time
    A-Star Search algorithms with interesting visualizations.
