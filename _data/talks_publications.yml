    In this article, I have implemented a fully vectorized python code of an Artificial Neural
    Network tested on multiple datasets. Further, dropout and L2 regularization techniques are
    implemented and explained in detail.

    This article explores the famous graph traversals, namely, Depth First Search (DFS), Breadth First Search (BFS),
    Uniform Cost Search (Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm), A-Star Search, Weighed A-Star Search and Learning Real Time
    A-Star Search algorithms with interesting visualizations.
