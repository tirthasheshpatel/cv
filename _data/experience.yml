   â€“ PyMC3 is a probabilistic programming package for Python that allows users to
     fit Bayesian models using a variety of numerical methods, most notably
     Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and variational inference (VI). Its
     flexibility and extensibility make it applicable to a large suite of problems.

    - My goal for GSoC 2020 is to implement, test, and maintain a higher-level API for
    Gaussian Processes in PyMC4 using TensorFlow and TensorFlow Probability and write
    tutorials/articles and notebooks explaining their usage.
    - My work consists of implementing Gaussian Process Models and writing optimization
    methods like Newton's Method and Powell's Method to find the maximum a-posteriori
    of the models. My goal is also to implement at least one approximation technique
    when full GP modelling becomes impractical
